## Fan count tools for Uma Musume Pretty Derby
A automatic fan counter to manage circle fan count to help you get that monthly goal in check

Project feature:
- Reading your screenshot folder
- Extracting name and fan numbers through ocr
- Compiling data into an excel spreadsheet

###How to use:
1. Screenshot your game windows using `Alt+Windows+Prnt Scrn`
2. Make sure the player card are aligned perfectly like this:  
<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1UjGUdic0DXqikaqIuepaqIVy1hUxX_43" width="250">
3. Since you can only view 2 player card per screenshot, you need 15 screenshot for 30 circle member
4. Move all the screenshot to `/pic` folder
5. Run the exe


Future plan:
- Better User Interface 
- Screenshotting umamusume.exe windows directly
- linking exported data with Google Sheets
